## 17 - 18 August : flow chart and sketch diagram in AI
considered the entire flow of the game and how players interact with the screen. As a result of doing more in-depth research and thinking about the sensor and Unity interaction part of the game, I had to change some of the game mechanics, and the in-game UI.
- Level 3: __Chinese character formation in a grid using sections.__ “森” or “晖”&“晕”？ and how to interact? (The idea so far is to have three sensors on the top left and right for selecting text relative to the position on the screen. But i can only do "confirmation" like clicking instead of "selection" like computer mouse movement)  ___I need to check with Mahalia___
- Level 4: __horizontal board game.__ aiming to encourage players to practice speaking Chinese. players need to read specific Chinese sentences and control the game character to move smoothly. ___game map references some voice-activated games___
